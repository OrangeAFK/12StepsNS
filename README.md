# 12StepsNS

## Purpose

This mini-project was created to follow along with Professor Lorena A. Barbara's _12 Steps To Navier Stokes_ (https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/). This is a didactic project to learn some basics of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and to provide performance baselines before attempting to speed up the solvers in each step with custom CUDA implementations in Python and C++ in a future mini-project.
